    "Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q&A retrieval performance may also be improved with techniques like HyDE, in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of keywords or search terms."
